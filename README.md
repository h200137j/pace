## What is Pace?

**Pace** is a beautifully crafted, offline-first habit and activity tracker built with Flutter. It's designed around one idea: *making it frictionless to show up every single day*.

Whether you're building a 30-day coding challenge, tracking a daily meditation practice, or logging focused deep-work sessions — Pace gives you the visual feedback and streak motivation to keep going.

No subscriptions. No cloud sync. No noise. Just you and your habits, stored privately on your device.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Three Activity Types
Create and track in three different modes depending on your goal:

| Type | Best For |
|---|---|
| **Challenge** | Time-boxed streaks — "30 days of running" |
| **Task** | Recurring daily habits — "Drink 2L of water" |
| **Focus** | Deep-work logging — "2 hours of coding" |

Each activity gets its own **color**, **icon**, and **target day schedule** (e.g. weekdays only).

---

### 📅 Frictionless Daily Check-In
Your home dashboard shows everything due today. A single tap on the animated progress ring marks a habit as **done** — no menus, no extra steps.

- Live **streak badge** 🔥 updates instantly
- **Week dot indicator** shows your last 7 days at a glance
- **Gradient cards** pulse with your chosen activity color

---

### 🔥 Streaks That Keep You Honest
Pace calculates your streaks in real-time, with zero approximation:

- **Current streak** — consecutive days done up to today
- **Longest streak** — your personal record, tracked forever
- **Completion rate** — percentage since you created the habit
- **Total completions** — raw count of every day you showed up

---

### 🗓️ GitHub-Style Contribution Grid
Every activity gets a **52-week heatmap** — just like GitHub's contribution graph. See your consistency across the entire year at one glance. Tap any cell for a day-specific tooltip.

```
Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May  ...
M  ░░░▒▒▒███░░░▒▒▒░░░███▒▒▒░░░
T  ▒▒▒░░░▒▒▒███░░░███▒▒▒░░░███
W  ███▒▒▒░░░░░░███░░░░░░███▒▒▒
```

---

### 📊 Rich Analytics (fl_chart)
Navigate to Analytics for beautiful, interactive charts:

- **Week View** — grouped bar chart comparing all activities over the last 7 days, plus individual progress bars per habit
- **Month View** — curved multi-line area chart tracking 30 days of activity patterns
- **Year View** — activity-selector + heatmap + monthly bar chart for the full calendar year

---

### 📤 Data Portability
Your data is yours. Always.

- **Export JSON** — full backup of all activities and completion records
- **Import JSON** — restore from any previous backup
- **Export CSV** — open your history in Excel, Google Sheets, or any tool you like

Backup format notes:
- JSON export `version: 2` includes gamification blocks (`gamificationProfile`, `badgeUnlocks`, `trophyUnlocks`, `xpEvents`)
- Activity export now includes `difficulty`
- Import remains backward compatible with older backups and rebuilds gamification state when needed

---

### 🏅 Gamification System
Pace now includes an offline-first progression layer:

- **Difficulty Levels** per activity: `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`, `Elite`
- **XP Awards** on completion with difficulty multipliers and photo bonus
- **Level Progression** shown on Home with XP-to-next-level progress
- **Achievement Badges** with tracked progress and unlock dates
- **Trophies** for larger milestones built on badge/meta progression

All gamification state is persisted in Isar and exported/imported with backups.

---

### 🎨 Material 3 Design
Pace is built on top of Flutter's latest Material 3 design system:

- Dynamic **seed-color theming** — pick any accent color and the entire UI adapts
- First-class **dark mode** support
- **Outfit** typography for a clean, modern reading experience
- Smooth micro-animations on every interaction
- FlexColorScheme surface blending for a polished, cohesive look

---
